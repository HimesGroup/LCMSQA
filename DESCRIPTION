Description: The goal of LCMSQA is to make it easy to check the quality of LC/MS
             experiments using a Shiny application. This package provides
             interactive data visualizations for quality control (QC) samples,
             including total ion current chromatogram (TIC), base peak
             chromatogram (BPC), mass spectrum, extracted ion chromatogram
             (XIC), and feature detection results from internal standards or
             known metabolites.
