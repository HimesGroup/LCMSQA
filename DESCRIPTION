Description: The goal of 'LCMSQA' is to make it easy to check the quality of
             liquid chromatograph/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) experiments using a
             'shiny' application. This package provides interactive data
             visualizations for quality control (QC) samples, including total
             ion current chromatogram (TIC), base peak chromatogram (BPC), mass
             spectrum, extracted ion chromatogram (XIC), and feature detection
             results from internal standards or known metabolites.
